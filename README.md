# **Summary**

- Over 7 plus years of experience developing back-end server applications, web applications, web services, microservices, applets, and client applications with strong focus on end-user's experience.
- Specialty in improving existing/legacy codebases and building scalable, performant, fault-tolerant back-end systems.
- Follower of good engineering practices such as test-driven design, pair programming, continuous integration, and refactoring. Committed to good coding principles such as SOLID, DRY, and YAGN.
- Over the career, developed high-availability RESTful middleware service layer used across multiple customer-facing applications to streamline connectivity and business logic across dozens of diverse backend services; bolstered with Hystrix circuit breakers, monitoring, handling over 2,000 requests/sec at peak load.  
- Completed certification courses namely DevOps CI/CD with Jenkins pipelines, Maven Gradle from Udemy. 
- Designed and implemented successful team branching strategy and written release process Jenkins pipelines. Created numerous process support scripts making use of GITLAB API used by Product Owners and Scrum masters, saving hours of manual work per week. 
- Utilized Java, Servlets, JSP, Git, Spring, SpringBoot, HTML/CSS, Oracle, JavaScript, Node.js, AngularJs , Maven/ Gradle build tool extensively throughout my career. 
- Refactored large legacy application to remove running container dependency on tests, simplify deployment infrastructure, and used standard JPA-style annotations for domain objects.

branching & release process.  
- Hands on experience in setting up git hooks to enforce preconditions for merging. 

Sending notifications to team’s chat window, checking out the status of branch builds. 
 
Code Base: (GitLab) 
Worked on automating as many development steps as possible (build ->test ->deploy). 
Enforced push policy to open a new merge request, mark it WIP and assign to respective 
reviewer. This needs three steps almost everyday

Automated above task to save manual work using GITLAB API. 
 
Building: Ant, Maven, Gradle 
                    Worked  on  build  tool  conversion 
from  ANT  to  Maven 
for  a  legacy  application.  This 
helped greatly embrace better lifecycle management & reduce the boilerplate code required for 
build phase.  
 
Maven: Expert in handling maven as build tool, configured weblogic plugins to achieve 
automated build deployments on WebLogic clusters. 
 
                    Code review & Coverage Testing: Junit, Jacoco, eclemma, Sonarlint, sonarqube  

- Extensive knowledge on code coverage strategy, by working through various Junit 
frameworks like Mockito/ powerMockito to carry out unit tests and configure Jacaco 
to generate html reports for unit testing.  

- Configured sonarqube within the pipeline to analyze the new code vulnerabilities.  
 
**Integration:** Jenkins 

- Worked on configuring multi-branch pipeline to support branching / release strategy 
by writing the required pipeline in groovy scripts. 

- Configured Jenkins credentials & wrote shell scripts to leverage automated 
deployments on WebLogic Clusters and PaaS simultaneously to support 
Strangler 
pattern (High Availability)

 
**Monitor:** Splunk, AppDynamics 
Hands on experience in setting up AppDynamics for real time monitoring of CPU usage and 
troubleshooting slowness across applications.  
Expert in Splunk query language, to create reports from kpi’s metrics from log data to present 
real time report on user activity & alert long running queries. 
 
**Pivotal Cloud foundry:**  
 

- Configured config servers, to externalize properties & deploy a micro service 
application into Paas. 

- Configured log drain through cf cups to route logs to a log server for log analytics. 

- Configured Appdynamics & splunk as service for monitoring the application realtime. 
 
- Extensive knowledge on cloud foundry commands that helped deploy application 
through CI/CD to Paas.
